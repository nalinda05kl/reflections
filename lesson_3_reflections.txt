When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Specially when I need  to share my work with others, remote repository is very usefull.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I would like my self to choose what and when the local repository to be updated. So manual pulling gives more control.
